# seismic-frequency-analysis
This project demonstrates a workflow for analyzing seismic waveform data using the ObsPy Python library. It includes downloading waveform data from IRIS, preprocessing the signal, computing the Fourier amplitude spectrum, estimating the corner frequency, and visualizing both the waveform and its frequency spectrum
